git doesn't store empty folders. Just make sure there's a file in the folder like doc/foo.txt 
and run git add doc or git add doc/foo.txt and the folder will be added to your local repo 
once you've committed (and appear on github once you've pushed it)

1. go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder.
2. click on New file.
3. on the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create.
4. then type / , this creates a folder.
