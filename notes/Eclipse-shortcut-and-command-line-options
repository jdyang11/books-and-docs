Allocating enough memory and solving OutOfMemoryErrors
eclipse -vmargs -Xmx<memory size>
with the <memory size> value set to greater than "1024M" (1024 megabytes -- the default).

Selecting a workspace
Use default content area for your projects as well as for holding any required metadata. 
For shared or multi-workspace installs you must explicitly specify the location for your workspace 
using the dialog (or via the " -data " command line argument).

Specifying the Java virtual machine
eclipse -vm c:\jdk6u22\jre\bin\javaw

Tip: It's generally a good idea to explicitly specify which Java VM to use when running Eclipse. 
This is achieved with the " -vm " command line argument as illustrated above. 
If you don't use " -vm ", Eclipse will look on the OS path. When you install other Java-based products, 
they may change your path and could result in a different Java VM being used when you next launch Eclipse.

*** To create a Windows shortcut to an installed Eclipse:

Navigate to eclipse.exe in Windows Explorer and use Create Shortcut on the content menu.
Select the shortcut and edit its Properties. In the Target: field append the command line arguments.
Opening this shortcut launches Eclipse. (You can drag the shortcut to the Windows Desktop if you want to keep it in easy reach.)
